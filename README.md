### **Function Testing**

As part of the testing I manually tested all inputs to ensure that the logic of the code was working as intended. I manually checked inputs to ensure the output matched what was expected. During my intial tests I discoverd an issue with the way the wild input was being calculated. This was fixed in commit [c3353e9](https://github.com/John-McPherson/7-Wonders-Science-Calculator/blob/1f9e59e7efd799d67f4d9464f7123ca672f5c780/assets/js/script.js). 

Once the bug had been resolved I reran my tests and everything worked as intended.

1. Go to the Github repository for the project.
